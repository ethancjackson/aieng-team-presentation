                    <h4>How We Train AI</h4>
                    <p>Models are trained on <em>everything at once</em>, then pressured via RLHF 
                    to suppress undesirable behaviors. They face <strong>zero social consequences</strong> 
                    for their outputs in deployment.</p>

                    <h4>How Humans Learn Values</h4>
                    <p>Children learn from early on that harmful actions lead to 
                    <strong>concrete, enforced consequences</strong>. This shapes intrinsic motivation — 
                    not just surface compliance.</p>

                What we can engineer are the <strong>environments</strong> in which adaptive behaviors emerge. 
                Not by dictating values, but by structuring their world such that <em>caring is how they survive</em>."
