Abstract
Despite often being perceived as morally objectionable, stereotypes are a common feature of social groups, a phenomenon that has often
been attributed to biased motivations or limits on the ability to process information. We argue that one reason for this continued
prevalence is that preexisting expectations about how others will behave, in the context of social coordination, can change the
behaviors of one’s social partners, creating the very stereotype one expected to see, even in the absence of other potential sources of
stereotyping. We use a computational model of dynamic social coordination to illustrate how this “feedback loop” can emerge,
engendering and entrenching role-consistent stereotypic behavior and then show that human behavior on the task generates a
comparable feedback loop. Notably, people’s choices on the task are not related to social dominance or system justification,
suggesting biased motivations are not necessary to maintain these stereotypes.
Keywords: reinforcement learning, agent-based model, stereotyping, social norms, coordination
Significance Statement
People often use social role stereotypes—generalized information about the roles associated with a social category—as a source of
information about the skills and preferences of strangers. Social role stereotypes simplify the task of learning how different people
behave but also create an expectation that group members will behave a certain way. When coordination is necessary for success,
these expectations can engender a feedback loop creating the very stereotype one expected to see. Our computational model of social
coordination shows how these feedback loops can emerge, and adults exhibit similar patterns of stereotypic behavior, irrespective of
their preexisting attitudes towards social inequality.
Introduction
The widespread presence of stereotyping—generalized, and often
exaggerated, inferences about individuals based on their social
category membership—is a broad social concern that presents a
challenge to group diversity. Groups contain individuals who
may have differing characteristics, skills, and needs; stereotypes
threaten this by projecting similarity onto members of a social
category that may not accurately reflect the diversity and variability
of individuals within it. Many classic and contemporary theories
of social cognition have sought to explain why otherwise
well-meaning individuals might nevertheless engage in stereotyping.
Some of these theories suggest that motivations such as promoting
one’s group at the expense of another’s (1, 2) or justifying
existing inequalities (3–5) conflict with norms against stereotyping;
others argue that the limits of human cognition make overly
simplistic generalization inevitable (6–8).
We argue that part of the reason stereotyping remains so
prevalent despite the existence of norms against is because these
stereotypes also result from the dynamics of social coordination,
where social partners shift their behaviors to align with the preexisting
expectations of the social environment in which they find
themselves. In large societies, people must interact with strangers
with whom they have almost no experience, requiring them to “go
beyond the information given” (9) to make inferences about
the traits, motivations, and beliefs of others based on secondary
cues. Many social category representations include beliefs about

the social roles that individuals within the category are suited for
(10, 11); these role-based stereotypes facilitate social cognition by
simplifying one’s representation of others, and ease social dilemmas
about how to divide labor (12), but they can lead to a vicious
cycle in which the target of an expectation who successfully
coordinates with a social partner amplifies that partner’s expectation
that the target will continue to behave according to that
expectation.
Using a combination of computational and behavioral work,
we illustrate how such dynamics can emerge from the cognitive
processes of individuals operating within a social system, and
how agents in these systems can inadvertently contribute to a social
structure that helps create, maintain, and strengthen social biases
against individuals based on their social roles.
Statistical regularities and social conventions
Modern human social groups are large and deeply complex. In order
to successfully develop and maintain these societies, people
must successfully learn to coordinate with one another, dividing
labor between individuals to allow for specialization and large-
scale cooperation (e.g. (12–15)).
Coordinating successfully in such large groups poses a challenge:
reliably knowing how to assign tasks with an individual requires
understanding that individual’s skill set, but as the size of a
social group increases, representing each individual within it with
high fidelity likewise incurs a greater cognitive cost. As finite cognitive
resources constrain the number of simultaneous close social
relationships we are able to entertain (16–19), several
theories of social cognition have characterized people as “efficiency
experts” (e.g. (6–8)) for whom group-based generalizations
result from an attempt to leverage the utility of low-cost category
knowledge, thus avoiding the more effortful task of individuation.
Generalizing these regularities to unfamiliar others, in turn, facilitates
the development of shared knowledge and the ability to coordinate
one’s behavior.
Given these potential advantages, social norms or conventions
that members of a group ought to engage in a particular behavior
or share a certain belief can further simplify the space of expected
behavior, easing coordination by making each group member
more predictable (20). For example, computational accounts of
the development and maintenance of conventions such as communication
and cooperative foraging have emphasized the need
not only to coordinate with individuals but to abstract these rules
for interactions away from individual relationships and generalize
them to a larger community (e.g. (21)), and punish those whose behavior
does not align with the norm (e.g. (22–25)).
The codification of regularities into expectations and social
conventions, while often providing substantial benefits to group
members, can come with potential drawbacks, both to individual
members within the group and also to the group as a whole. By
compressing our highly complex social environments into easily
interpretable generalized beliefs about social categories, individuals
whose skills or preference do not match what a convention dictates
can be unfairly disadvantaged.
Game theory has long used economic games such as the
Bach-Stravinsky game (also known as the Battle of the Sexes;
see e.g. (26, 27)) to model how self-interested agents (and subgroups
of agents) develop stable strategies for coordinating with
one another. Coordination in such games reliably outperforms
uncoordinated behavior, but in many cases, the rewards of coordination
are not equally distributed. At the individual level, even
when groups have an equal underlying distribution of skills
(i.e. which group specializes in which task is ultimately arbitrary),
the fact that many specialized tasks within human societies require
substantial investment creates strong incentives for individuals
to coordinate, even when it is personally detrimental (e.g.
(28)). Coordination can also result in disadvantages for groups as
a whole; for example, when coordination involves tasks with unequal
rewards, one group is reliably disadvantaged (12), particularly
when tasks provide surpluses (14) or when one group is
smaller than another (29, 30). In all of these cases, while coordination
may be useful in the sense that it results in better outcomes
as a whole, it can come at the cost of disadvantaging those whose
skills are not reflected by this simplified representation.
Learning signals and feedback loops
Although game-theoretic analyses have provided a powerful tool
for understanding how inequality can emerge from the need to coordinate,
these models often do not capture the process by which
individuals within a society learn and change their behavior.
When learning agents attempt to coordinate, their actions also
change one another’s reasoning about optimal actions. For example,
believing that one’s partner prefers to clean and does not
like to cook might make one more likely to offer to cook than to
clean, all else being equal; however, this also means that one’s partner
is more likely to offer to clean than to cook in the future, even if
the partner actually had no strong feelings to begin with.
In this way, learning systems can create positive feedback loops
between expectations and outcomes. When these inferences involve
generalized beliefs about social categories as a whole, they
regularize one’s experience of social groups more than would be
expected by chance, strengthening the associations between a social
category and an expectation not just for oneself, but also for
newly introduced agents.
Another limitation to modeling coordination with game theory
is that these models cannot capture agents’ beliefs about regularities—whether
agents believe groups have underlying differences,
or whether regularities reflect an arbitrary convention agreed upon
for the sake of efficiency or mutual benefit. If agents believe the
outcomes of a coordinated system reflect an essential difference
between groups, they may resist changes to that system and justify
its resulting inequalities; however, this tendency may be mitigated
if the convention is perceived as an arbitrary rule that it is possible
to arbitrarily change.
One piece of evidence that agents’ preexisting beliefs can contribute
to the feedback loop described above comes from the phenomenon
of “behavioral confirmation” observed for a number of
real-world social categories, such as race and gender (31, 32). In
one such task by Skrypnek and Snyder (33), male and female students
were paired together and tasked with negotiating a division
of labor to solve a set of stereotypically masculine and feminine tasks
without face-to-face interaction. Male students allocated more masculine
tasks to their partners when they believed they were negotiating
with a male student; on the following task, the female students
who had been perceived as male allocated more masculine tasks
for themselves. Thus, the initial perceiver’s stereotypic beliefs about
men and women were not only confirmed by the target’s behavior in
the first task, but strengthened by the target’s own subsequent
choices. Therefore, if such role-based stereotypes can emerge from
behavioral confirmation, then generalized conventions that disadvantage
or misrepresent a group of individuals can emerge even
among unbiased individuals with sufficient cognitive capacity
to fully represent the complexity of their social interactions.
Comparable dynamics can emerge from approach-contingent

learning biases, wherein initially negative exposures result in entrenched
avoidance of a group, which prevents further learning
(e.g. (34, 35)).
This possibility offers a potential answer to a fundamental
question in social psychology: why people engage in stereotyping,
despite endorsing moral norms against the use of stereotyping. In
such situations, people may believe that they are simply drawing
statistically appropriate conclusions about how groups are likely
to behave (36, 37), even though their own professed belief may itself
create, entrench, and strengthen the stereotype that individuals
within a group are well-suited to a specific social role and will
therefore behave role consistently.
We illustrate the development of role-based stereotypic conventions
within populations of skilled agents that learn and
change in response to their environment using multiagent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). MARL models are an emerging tool
in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science to understand
social interaction and coordination problems (38–42), particularly
those involving the emergence of social conventions (24,
25, 43), and open several new lines of inquiry that have not been
possible using traditional game-theoretic approaches. Using our
models, we test two hypotheses regarding the emergence of stereotypic
conventions: (i) that these effects are most prominent in larger
populations, as coordination around group labels is learned
more quickly than the skills of individual agents and (ii) that learning
agents develop a structure that is learned and perpetuated by
subsequent generations of new agents, such that agents’ initial expectations
continue to affect the structure of the world even when
those agents are no longer observed.
These models allow us to test whether agents optimizing their
own anticipated rewards will develop and persist in stereotypic
patterns of behavior. However, while this provides a baseline for
agents optimizing expected utility, human beings can act against
their economic interests to behave prosocially (e.g. (44–46)). Thus,
people who are aware that an underlying convention is arbitrary
in ways that disadvantage a group would be less likely to endorse
that convention—but only to the extent that they are aware such a
difference exists. By testing human participants on a comparable
scenario to our MARL models, we can directly elicit explicit beliefs
about the structure of the environment that they are learning in,
allowing us to link the stereotypic actions that may result from social
coordination, to the stereotypic beliefs that exist in our daily
life. If human participants believe that the conventions observed
in our tasks reflect a true, underlying essential difference, then
participants on our task should not only make stereotype-
consistent choices, they should do so irrespective of individual differences
in tolerance for social inequality.
Task setup
At a high level, we investigate the effect of this feedback loop on
an environment in which there are differences in the benefits or
needs of individual members within a social group. For example,
a social group might have a larger number of people who are
skilled lumberjacks, and a smaller number who are skilled miners.
In a large enough social group, this group might be represented
as “lumberjacks,” establishing a norm that members of
the group ought to chop wood. If the group’s success depends on
successful coordination, the mechanisms of expectation and enforcement—the
“carrot” and the “stick” of convention formation
—systematically disadvantage those who would be better served
by mining, even as the majority is advantaged. Worse yet, if the
disadvantaged miners do accede to the norm, engaging in
Gelpí et al. | 3
chopping wood despite their lack of skill, this strengthens the perceived
regularity that members of the group are lumberjacks, and
worsens the misrepresentation by the broader population of the
underlying diversity of the social group.
We adapt the AI economist paradigm (47, 48) to model this environment.
Agents in our studies participate in a produce-and-trade
task where they collect resources from the environment, which
they can use to trade with a market decider (described below) in exchange
for rewards (Fig. 1). By making agents’ rewards contingent
on successful trades with an external market, this task allows for
analyzing how the agents’ and markets’ simultaneous learning of
the dynamics leads to patterns of social coordination.
Although the coordination demand between the agent and the
market may seem to be trivially resolved, e.g. by communicating
one’s intentions in advance, thus preventing failures due to misaligned
behaviors, this setup is identical to a typical coordination
problem, and serves as an abstraction for situations where individuals
actively select interactions with others about whom they
know very little beyond preexisting beliefs about a social category.
Thus, the market functions as a simplification of generalized
society-wide beliefs about the degree to which an individual
agent’s social category membership predicts its conformity to a
social role.
Each agent’s input consists of its current reward value as well
as its resource total (wood and stone). Each agent takes a single action
per turn, with an action space of seven total possible actions.
Three actions are independent actions: chopping wood (receive 1
wood), mining stone (receive 1 stone), or building a house (consume
1 wood and 1 stone, receive 15 points of reward). These actions
do not involve the market decider, and their success rate
depends on the skill levels of each agent (e.g. an agent with a skill
level of 0.95 in chopping would successfully receive 1 wood on 95%
of trials spent chopping).
The other four actions are social actions: buying wood, selling
wood, buying stone, or selling stone. Successful selling actions require
coordination between the agents and the market decider.
Whenever an agent decides to sell a resource, the market decider
has to predict the resource that the agent is selling; the transaction
is only completed if the market decider makes the correct
guess about what the agent is attempting to sell. After a successful
transaction, the agent trades away 2 units of wood or stone, and
receives 1 point of reward. Buying actions do not require coordination;
if an agent buys a resource from the market decider, it loses
2 points of reward and receives 1 unit of wood or stone.
Unlike the agents, the market decider does not necessarily act
at every timestep, nor is it limited to acting only once every timestep;
rather, it only takes an action when agents opt to sell to the
market decider. In each trade, the market decider’s input consists
of a unique 16-digit binary code corresponding to the agent’s identity.
The market decider receives positive or negative rewards depending
on its prediction of agents’ selling behaviors. It receives
1 point of reward when an agent successfully sells a resource to
it, loses 1 point of reward if it does not correctly predict the agent’s
behavior, and loses 0.3 points of reward if it makes a successful
prediction, but the agent does not have enough resources to
make a successful transaction.
Results
The design of the social group structure in our studies is aimed to
enable the possibility of the emergence of social conventions.
Thus, although agents can specialize in any behavior (mining,
chopping, or building), we focus our analyses on the behaviors

Fig. 1. Nontechnical schematic of task design. Agents (top) with varying skill specializations observe their own resources and input this information into
a neural network to determine their actions. The market decider (bottom) observes the agent’s appearance when it chooses to sell to the market, and

agents’/market decider’s reward) depend on the prediction matching the agent’s action.
of mining and chopping specialist agents, and the degree to which
they adhere to conventions in groups that are composed of a majority
of choppers or miners. When selling to the market decider,
these agents can behave according to their skill (by offering to sell
the resource that they are skilled at collecting) or contrary to their
skill (by offering to sell the resource that they are not skilled at collecting).
Below, we examine the proportion of skill-based predictions
by the market decider, and the proportion of skilled and
unskilled behaviors by agents to measure the emergence of group-
level conventions among the groups.
Study 1: Individuation
To determine whether our model has the capacity to fully individuate
all of the agents, we first conduct a series of baseline experiments,
in which agents are assigned their identity codes randomly, and
there is no correlation between these codes and the agent’s skill.
Thus, for the agents and the market decider to successfully coordinate,
the market decider must learn to predict each agent’s skill based
on its unique identity code. If agents act according to their skills on
this task, then any stereotyping effects observed in later studies
must result from something other than a lack of model expressivity.
Further, we can observe how differences in population size are reflected
in the time it takes our models to learn individuals’ skills.
Our results from this study suggest that the basic structure of
the task is learnable by both the agents and the market decider,
giving us a benchmark of how well our market decider model is
capable of representing individuals’ unique skill. Agents predominantly
behave according to their skill; for example, skilled
choppers mostly chop wood and sell wood, while skilled miners
mostly mine stone and sell stone (Fig. 2A and B). Meanwhile, the
market decider learns to expect that agents will behave according
to their skilled behavior to a high degree of accuracy; the market
decider’s predictions match agents’ skilled behavior 95% of the
time (Fig. 2C).
The market decider is most accurate at making skill-based predictions
when the size of the population is smaller, F(3,7988)= 1692.53,
P< 0.001,η2
p
= 0.39, and the market decider’s predictions become
more accurate over time, F(1,7988)= 14127.42, P< 0.001,η2
= 0.64.
p
However, the larger the population, the longer it takes for
the market decider to reach a high level of accuracy,
F(3,7988)= 615.39, P< 0.001,η2
p
= 0.19 (Fig. 3A). Broadly, we find
that although the time taken to learn the population varies based
on the group size, the market decider is able to predict how agents
are likely to behave according to their true underlying skills. Due to
the structure of the learning task in this condition, however, the market
decider’s accuracy in its predictions about how unobserved
agents are likely to behave cannot change from 50% throughout
training, because the skills and identity of unobserved agents is uncorrelated
with the skills and identity of existing agents.
Study 2: Regularity
As population sizes increase, people have fewer opportunities to
learn about each individual within a population; correspondingly,
people may rely on secondary cues such as group identity if these
cues can predict any existing variance. To the extent that these
secondary cues are used for prediction in coordination tasks,
and these predictions lead to expectations that influence others’
behavior, we should expect that when a secondary cue is statistically
correlated with a skilled behavior, all agents with that cue
should behave more conventionally, even if this means behaving
in a way that conflicts with the agent’s personal skill.
In study 2, we examine this by making each agent’s skills statistically
correlated with three of the digits of the agent’s identity
code, thus functioning as a group label. While 50% (the majority)
of the agents with a given group label share a skill specialization,
the remaining 50% is split evenly between the other two skill specializations
(the minorities). In the groups where the majority of
agents are chopping or mining specialists, this yields a ratio of

2:1 between the size of the chopping or mining specialist majority
and the corresponding mining or chopping specialist minority, respectively
(see Figs. S2–S5for results with other ratios).
Critically, all individuating information from study 1 is still present,
so it is possible for the model to fully learn each agent’s
skilled behavior. However, because both the market decider and
the agents are learning the task dynamics simultaneously, if the
market decider develops expectations about agents based on the
group label before it has learned individual agents’ skills, then
agents may begin to display behavioral confirmation, establishing
a stereotypic convention that regularizes the market decider’s
learning signal and precludes any ability to learn about individuals’
unique skilled behaviors.
We find this behavioral confirmation effect emerges in study
2. The market decider quickly learns to predict that agents with
a given group label will mostly attempt to sell the same resource
that the majority of their group is skilled at collecting, i.e. predicting
that most agents in the majority-miner group will bring stone,
and most agents in the majority-chopper group will bring wood
(Fig. 2F). As a result, agents in these conditions act according to
the group label observed by the market decider, rather than their
own personal skills: the minority group engages in a significantly
lower proportion of skilled actions than agents in study 1
(extraction: B= −0.209, SE= 0.002, 95% CI= [− 0.213,− 0.205],
z= −122.66, P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= −1.42; sales: B= −0.11,
SE= 0.001, 95% CI= [− 0.111,− 0.109], z= −83.02, P< 0.001,
Cohen'sd= −0.96; Fig. 2D and E), and by contrast, majority group
members engage in a slightly greater proportion of skilled actions
than agents in study 1 (extraction: B= 0.065, SE= 0.002,
95% CI= [0.061,0.069], z= 38.15, P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= 0.44; sales:
B= 0.037, SE= 0.001, 95% CI= [0.035,0.041], z= 27.90, P< 0.001,
Cohen'sd= 0.32). Thus, even though the same market decider
model was capable of learning individuals’ skills to a high degree
of accuracy, the confounded statistical cue leads the model to engage
in stereotyped predictions.
Study 2 also illustrates how the complexity of learning each individual
as population size increases affects the market decider’s
predictions when there is a statistical regularity. It is more difficult
and time-consuming to learn the individual skill of each
agent in a larger population. On the other hand, a statistical
regularity—that more agents with a given group label have a particular
skill—can be learned more quickly because of its simplicity.
Further, it does not become more difficult to learn as the
population size increases. In a population size of 30, the market
decider predicts that agents with the minority skill in a group
will behave according to their own skill most of the time, albeit
still less often than the majority agents (B= 0.080, SE= 0.002,
95% CI= [0.076,0.085], z= 43.01, P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= 0.78);

A B
Fig. 3. Market predictions with differing population sizes. In study 1 A), the market decider learns to predict that agents will sell the resource that
matches their skill. Larger population sizes take longer to learn but does not affect the ultimate frequency of skill-based predictions. In study 2 B), the
market decider’s predictions quickly converge to skill-based predictions the majority group members (i.e. chopping specialists sell wood and mining
specialists sell stone); however, the market decider’s predictions for minority members depends on group size, such that the market decider
makes mostly skilled-based predictions for the minority in the population size of 100, but almost exclusively stereotypic predictions for the
population size of 600.
however, as the population size increases, the market decider’s
predictions, and consequently the agents’ behaviors, become
more highly stereotyped, with minority agents becoming much
less likely to behave according to their skills than majority agents
(all z ≥ 116.99, P< 0.001, Cohen’s d ≥ 2.14; Fig. 3B).
As both the market decider and the agents are learning the task
dynamics simultaneously, the fact that the market decider rapidly
learns and applies a statistical cue before it is able to learn individuals’
skilled behavior means that agents begin to change their
own behaviors to match the market decider’s predictions. In other
words, these predictions result in a behavioral confirmation effect
—the market decider’s predictions lead agents to behave in a more
stereotypic fashion. This behavior is, in turn, observed by the market
decider, strengthening and entrenching the prediction it
makes about these agents.
Study 3: Generational transmission
In study 2, we demonstrate that behavioral confirmation can develop
simply by including a statistical cue that is more easily
learned than an individual’s skill. This effect, in particular, disadvantages
agents whose skill specialization is a minority within the
larger group.
However, social environments are not static, and it is possible for
underlying characteristics such as the correlation between a secondary
cue and a skill to change over time. Stereotypic expectations
developed over the course of history might be capable of maintaining
stereotypic behaviors long after any underlying group differences
have faded. In study 3, we examine how stereotype-consistent
behavior can be maintained from stereotypic group-based expectations,
even when groups have no underlying differences.
In this study, we continue to train the models from study 2, but begin
to iteratively replace agents from the population, 20% at a time,
with agents whose skill specializations are uncorrelated with the
group label (i.e. an equal proportion of chopping and mining specialists).
After all agents have been replaced, we additionally replace the
market decider with a new, untrained market decider. At this point,
there is no longer any statistical regularity between the group label
and the agents’ skills, similar to study 1, and the new market decider
has not developed expectations about any of the agents.
Because the initial market decider’s expectations have already
been established and reinforced, new agents face a strong pressure
to behave according to the existing convention. Regardless of their
true skills, new agents are rewarded if they can successfully coordinate
with the market decider. As a result, although new agents introduced
into the environment are evenly divided between
chopping and mining specialists, these agents increasingly behave
according to the stereotypic convention, and the difference between
majority and minority agents’ selling and extracting behavior
becomes progressively more stereotyped between the initial
replacement and the final replacement, all B ≥ 0.21, SE= 0.002,
z ≥ 109.02, P< 0.001, Cohen'sd ≥ 1.99 (Fig. 2G and H). This pattern
of increasingly stereotyped behavior by both minority and
majority agents suggests that the behavioral confirmation of the
market decider can create self-sustaining stereotypic behavior in
the absence of underlying group differences. As the market decider’s
learning signal becomes progressively more stereotypic
(Fig. 4B), the market decider, in turn, develops progressively
more stereotypic expectations about the groups as agents are
replaced, B= 0.084, SE= 0.003, 95% CI= [0.078,0.089], z= 29.59,
Cohen'sd= 1.08, even though the underlying differences are actually
becoming smaller with each replacement (Figs. 2I and 4A).
Lastly, we find that upon replacing the market decider, the
agents continue to engage in a pattern of stereotypic behavior.
Due to the expectations of the previous market decider, and the
convention that emerges as a result of this expectation, agents
have learned that maximizing their rewards within the structure
of the environment requires acting in accordance with the
stereotypic convention; subsequently, the new market decider—
learning to predict in an environment with no underlying group
differences—nevertheless develops stereotypic expectations for
the groups matching those of the previous market decider.

Fig. 4. Raw learning signal and market predictions for unobserved agents. A) Proportion of stereotypic predictions by the market decider for previously
observed majority agents (blue), minority agents (red), and held-out unobserved agents (green) in study 3. The market stably predicts that unseen agents
will mostly engage in stereotypic actions at a greater rate than the ground truth skill distribution (dashed red line), even as the underlying skill
distribution changes. B) Market decider’s raw learning signal for mining and chopping groups. As the market decider’s expectations prompt minority
agents to engage in against-skill behaviors, the decider’s learning signal exaggerates the underlying difference in skill sets, and maintains it after the
underlying difference disappears.
Collective rewards.
As the market decider in study 1 learns to represent agents as individuals,
the average collective reward obtained by agents increases.
We find that in study 2, the collective reward obtained
by agents once the agents and the market decider are fully trained
is slightly smaller, but comparable to study 1 (B= 0.13, SE= 0.02,
95% CI= [0.08,0.18], z= 6.21, P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= 0.35). This effect
is driven by the rewards obtained by the majority agents, who
obtain a higher reward than comparable agents in study 1
(B= 1.36, SE= 0.055, 95% CI= [1.23,1.49], z= 24.79, P< 0.001,
Cohen'sd= 0.49); meanwhile, minority agents obtain a lower reward
(B= −3.62, SE= 0.055, 95% CI= [− 3.75,− 3.49], z= −66.04,
P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= −1.31).
In study 3, the collective reward becomes lower as agents are
replaced. By the time all agents and the market decider have
been replaced and the market decider is fully trained, the collective
reward obtained by the agents is significantly lower than in
study 2 (B= 1.39, SE= 0.01, 95% CI= [1.37,1.42], z= 141.18,
P< 0.001, Cohen'sd= 3.65; see Fig. S1).
Study 4: Human trajectories
As we observed the potential for stereotypes to persist and entrench
across generations of artificial agents with no motivations
beyond maximizing their own potential returns, we assessed human
performance on the same task. If human participants make
predictions based on group-based expectations and match others’
expectations through behavioral confirmation, we anticipate that
these patterns of behavior will emerge on a task comparable to the
simulated environments we developed. Importantly, we anticipate
that these behaviors emerge due to the nature of achieving
social coordination itself, rather than motivational biases; thus,
we expect that the degree of stereotyping shown by participants
in these studies will not be correlated to other potential factors associated
with stereotyping, such as system justification (3, 4) or
social dominance orientation (5, 49). In other words, the degree
to which individuals engage in stereotype-consistent reasoning
or behavior in our tasks should not be correlated with the individuals’
motivations to stereotype about social groups.
To test our predictions, we conducted a preregistered study in
which 447 human participants completed a web experiment containing
an adapted form of the environment from studies 1 to 3. In
this task, participants were placed in the role of either an agent, collecting
resources and attempting to sell them to the market decider,
or a market decider, predicting the resources being sold by agents.
Participants interacted with a market decider or agents whose behavior
trajectories were collected from one run of study 3 and were
randomly presented with a trajectory from the original agents or
market, the agents or market after two replacements, or the agents
and market after all five replacements. As most majority agents in
study 3 were predicted to behave skill-consistently, and we wished
to compare participants’ behavior in the context of being stereotyped
or successfully individuated, all participants participating as
agents in the task played the role of minority agents. Participants
had identical action spaces to the artificial agents, and participants’
skillsets (wood or stone) were counterbalanced between participants.
After completing the task, participants completed three social
orientation scales: the System Justification Scale (SJS, adapted from
Ref. (50)), the Social Dominance Orientation scale (SDO, (49)), and the
Basic Social Justice Orientation scale (BSJO, (51)). Participants in the
agent task additionally answered questions about their beliefs regarding
the value of different resources, their learning of the task
structure, and their performance relative to others. Participants in
the market task answered questions about their beliefs regarding
the percentage of agents in each group that were skilled at collecting
different resources and the fairness of the world they encountered.
To assess the degree to which human participants demonstrated
a similar response pattern to the artificial agents, we first
tested human participants’ actions on the agent task. As with the
artificial agents, human participants assigned to agents for whom

Fig. 5. Agent task with human participants. Participants were assigned to play the role of agents the produce-and-trade task in which the market
predicted the agent would bring resources consistent with the agent’s true skill (blue) or contrary to the participant’s true skill (red). Participants
predicted to behave skill-consistently by the market decider progressively made a higher proportion of skill-consistent sales over time, while this
proportion declined for participants for which the market made mostly skill-inconsistent prediction (A). Further, the proportion of agents for which the
market made skill-consistent predictions was higher for the initial agents than for the agents from replacement 2 and replacement 5 (B).

the resources brought by agents to the market. Across all three conditions, participants predicted that agents who formed the majority within their group
would behave more skill-consistently than agents who formed the minority, and this pattern became stronger over time such that in later trials,
participants made more stereotypic predictions about both the majority and the minority.
the market decider predicted would bring resources against the
participants’ true skill were less likely to bring resources they
were skilled at collecting, B= −2.41, SE= 0.171, z= −14.12,
95% CI= [− 2.75,− 2.08], OR= 0.09, P< 0.001, and became progressively
less likely to do so in later trials, B= −1.22, z= −15.84,
95% CI= [− 1.37,− 1.07], P< 0.001 (Fig. 5).
Likewise, human participants on the market decider task displayed
a stereotypic effect consistent with the artificial agents.
Participants predicted that agents would bring the same resource
that a majority of the agents of the same color brought, making
them more likely to make skill-consistent predictions for majority
agents than for minority agents, B= 1.97, SE= 0.03, z= −63.25,
95% CI= [1.91,2.03], OR= 7.17, P< 0.001. This effect also became
stronger in later trials, B= 0.23, SE= 0.03, z= 7.47,
95% CI= [0.17,0.29], OR= 1.26, P< 0.001 (Fig. 6).
On average, participants believed that most members of a group
shared a single skill (e.g. agents with a purple body color are more
likely to attempt to sell stone) corresponding to the most
commonly observed action. When some or all of the agents had
been replaced, they overestimated the proportion of the group
that shared this skill, believing that the skill was more common
in the group than it truly was (replacement 2: M= 6.1%, SE= 1.89,
t(210)= 3.21, P= 0.002; replacement 5: M= 19.3%, SE= 1.77,
t(210)= 10.91, P< 0.001). Further, beliefs about the degree to which
groups of agents shared a single skill also predicted the degree to
which participants made predictions consistent with that skill for
both majority and minority agents. Participants who believed
that the majority’s skill was more common within a group
were more likely to make skill-consistent predictions for majority
agents, B= 0.63, SE= 0.026, z= 24.46, 95% CI= [0.58,0.69],
OR= 1.88, P< 0.001 but were more likely to make skill-inconsistent
predictions for minority agents, B= −0.77, SE= 0.035, z= 21.98,
95% CI= [− 0.84,− 0.70], OR= 0.46, P< 0.001.
Participants also indicated that they believed the world was
more fair than unfair for the aliens (M= 3.33, SD= 0.78, 1 = least
fair, 5= most fair), and 41% of participants indicated that the world
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/3/pgaf076/8051443 by guest on 06 January 2026
was very or somewhat fair, while only 13% indicated that the world
was somewhat unfair. None indicated that the world was very
unfair.
Participants’ differences in SJS and SDO did not meaningfully
predict the degree to which they engaged in stereotype-consistent
decision-making (SJS: b= −0.12, 95% CI= [− 0.18,− 0.06], 100%
in ROPE; SDO: b= 0.04,95% CI= [− 0.02,0.10], 100% in ROPE).
There was positive evidence that BSJO led participants to less
strongly distinguish between the majority and minority agents
(b= 0.27, 95% CI= [0.20,0.34], 0% in ROPE).
An analysis of the error rates indicated that being higher in BSJO
did not lead participants to be more accurate about minority group
members, but rather had higher error rates on majority group members,
B= −0.14, SE= 0.04, 95% CI= [− 0.22,− 0.06], z= −3.32,
P< 0.001, and equivalent error rates on minority group members,
B= 0.01, SE= 0.04, 95% CI= [− 0.07,0.10], z= 0.33, P= 0.74.
Although this may suggest that BSJO was associated with not using
the agents’ color to strategically undermine the structural inequality,
this interpretation is less likely given that (i) higher BSJO participants
thought that the world was more fair than other participants,
B= 0.22, SE= 0.05, t(211)= 4.27, P< 0.001, η2
p
= 0.08 and that (ii) individual
differences in the degree to which these participants saw
the game as fair or unfair did not moderate the effect of BSJO on error
rates (B= −0.24, SE= 1.40, t(209)= −0.17, P= 0.86, η2
p < 0.001).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that agents rapidly regularize around
group-based social conventions that facilitate a simple coordination
strategy. This tendency was particularly strong in larger populations,
in which learning the skills of each individual was more time-
consuming and costly, initially providing a predictive advantage to a
convention-based strategy. However, as this regularity became established,
it became a learning signal in its own right, making it difficult
to dislodge the convention for both agents and market
deciders, as well as the human participants playing these roles.
Human participants behaved comparably to the predictions
made by the models, aligning their actions with the market decider’s
expectations—even when these expectations involved collecting
resources they were unskilled at. They also developed
stereotypes based on appearance rather than individual skills.
Critically, these role-based stereotypes were not used simply as a
heuristic to maximize rewards, irrespective of the underlying structure
of the world, but were seen as a reflection of the true state of the
world (see e.g. (52)).
As participants considered the strong learning signal of the
groups’ distinct behavior to reflect real essential differences between
groups, participants’ choices were not affected by their attitudes
towards real-world social inequality, that might otherwise
have provided a motivation for individuals to behave stereotypically
even though doing so could disadvantage minority members of a
group. In fact, participants with higher scores in BSJO believed the
structure of the world within our tasks was more fair than those
with lower BSJO scores.
These findings suggest that role-based stereotyping may be particularly
prone to emerging—and particularly resistant to change—
in larger populations. In these contexts, one’s experience with a single
individual of a group is a small part of one’s experience with the
group as a whole. As a result, individuals within these societies may
be more likely to perceive the differences they observe to reflect real
underlying differences rather than an artifact of the demands of social
coordination, especially when conformity to the expectations of
a role is otherwise high. Modern social groupings, with sizes in the
Gelpí et al. | 9
millions and more, may be particularly vulnerable to the development
and persistence of stereotypes, posing a unique threat to the
potential for diversity and individuality within highly connected
contemporary societies. Because these expectations dictate the
structure of the subsequent coordination, expectations can amplify
the associations between social roles and social categories and lead
them to persist even if the factors that initially differentiated social
categories disappear.
Role-based stereotypic conventions create a dilemma for
agents whose skills do not match the expectation. If they continue
to sell the resource they are skilled at collecting, they often fail to
coordinate with the market decider or obtain any rewards.
However, if they sell the resource they are unskilled at collecting,
they reinforce the market decider’s expectations. This dynamic
compels agents to conform to the stereotype, suppressing their individual
strengths.
The fact that human participants on our tasks made similar
choices despite differing degrees of motivation to reject social inequality
suggests that these humans’ egalitarian attitudes and
aversion to stereotyping were unable to prevent the emergence
of similar degrees of unequal outcomes for the artificial agents,
because most participants believed that the differences in the behavior
they observed were reflective of a fair society in which
groups are largely homogeneous and differ based on their skills,
not simply because human beings were maximizing their own
rewards.
Although the threat of stereotyping is often recognized as a social
problem in that people identify and endorse moral norms against
the use of stereotypes (36, 53), including across political ideologies
(37), our results may shed light on why some forms of stereotyping,
particularly role-based stereotypes, remain a ubiquitous feature of
human societies. If behavioral confirmation can generate and perpetuate
conventions that certain groups are more suited for certain
roles or behaviors (e.g. (10)), then subsequent generations observe
real-world confirmation of these stereotypic beliefs, making it
seem as if the expectation was justified all along. Similarly, human
participants on our tasks engaged in stereotypic behavior, but they
did so because they believed that their beliefs about the agents were
statistically accurate generalizations.
The fact that patterns of stereotypic behavior can remain in
place even when the underlying group differences are no longer
consistent with the equilibrium reached by the group-based convention
suggests that role-based stereotypes may represent the
“kernel” around which other kinds of stereotypes about social categories
could form and accumulate. Thus, our findings should serve
as a caution against succumbing to a “naturalistic fallacy” in stereotyping:
the idea that observed differences between groups is due to
an underlying or essential characteristic of the groups, rather than
due to other explanations such as structural or historical factors.
For example, the existence of the “gender-equality paradox”—the
observation that gender segregation by occupation is stronger in
gender-egalitarian countries—has sometimes been explained as revealing
intrinsic differences between men’s and women’s interests
when given a free choice to pursue a career (e.g. (54)). However, consistent
with stereotype-based explanations for the gender-equality
paradox (e.g. (55)), our data illustrate how beliefs about what is perceived
to be a rational decision process driven by free choice, such
as choosing one’s career, could become biased by the development
of these stereotypic norms.
The mechanisms by which perpetuation of stereotypic conventions
can occur also provides us a method for understanding
how inequalities persist. For example, although the coordination
tasks we introduce in these studies are in principle
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/3/pgaf076/8051443 by guest on 06 January 2026

equitable with regards to the rewards provided to agents, in
practice a proportion of agents were disadvantaged by the
stereotype, because they were not able to live up to their full potential.
Furthermore, many real-world instances of coordination
result in divisions of labor that are unequal, particularly to
structurally disadvantaged or numerically smaller groups (e.g.
(29, 30)). Thus, the effects we observe in this work can be extended
to understand when conformity to a stereotypic convention
may emerge even when a group as a whole is disadvantaged
by the convention, rather than disadvantaging a minority of
agents within a group.
Materials and methods
Environment setup
The task for our agents i ∈ I= {1···N} can be formalized as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Each agent i
has an observation size v, observation function Oi : S→Rv
, and
action set Ai; for the producing agents, v= 6 and Ai = 7, and for
the market decider, v= 16 and Ai = 2. State transitions are determined
according to the transition probability T(S′|S,A), with
each agent receiving rewards ri ∈ Raccording to the reward function
R: S× A→R.
At each timestep, the producing agents observe a six-digit vector
indicating their own resource pool (quantity of coins, stone,
and wood, and whether each respective quantity is above 0),
and select an action from a list of seven possible actions (extract
stone, extract wood, build, sell stone, sell wood, buy stone, buy
wood). Simultaneously, the market decider observes the 16-digit
binary vector representing the identity of the agent that attempts
to sell stone or wood and selects one of two actions (predict the
agent will sell stone or wood). Both the agents and the market decider
must learn a policy mapping observed states to action probabilities
based on the long-term expected discounted reward,
Ei[􏽐∞
t=0γtri,t].
In all studies, the probability that certain actions (extracting
stone, extracting wood, and extracting skill) will be successfully
completed by agents is dependent on their skill level. Agents are
instantiated with one of three specializations: chopping, mining,
or building specialist. The choppers are good at chopping (0.75)
and bad at mining (0.25) and building (0.05). The miners are
good at mining (0.75) and bad at chopping (0.25) and building
(0.05). The builders are good at building (0.95) and bad at chopping
and mining (both 0.1; see also Figs. S6–S8for results with other hyperparameters).
Agents receive 15 points of reward for successfully
building a house, receive 1 point of reward for successfully
selling wood or stone, and lose 2 points of reward for buying
wood or stone from the market decider.
Agent architecture and training method
In all three studies, each agent and market decider comprised an
independent neural network (including the agents serving as replacers
in study 3). These networks were identical in architecture
and were initialized with random weights at the start of each experimental
condition. All models were structured using an actor-
critic architecture (56). Each model consisted of an actor network
producing an action policy and a critic network outputting a state
value estimate. Both networks consisted of a three-layer fully connected
multilayer perceptrons (MLP) (Actor and Critic) with 64
hyperbolic tangent units (tanh) in the first and third layers and
128 units in the second layer. The critic network outputs a scalar
representing the estimated value of the current state. The actor
network produces a probability over the actions to be chosen (seven
actions for the agents and two for the market).
What the agents and the market decider observe shares the
same structure across the three studies. At each step within an
epoch, each agent observed the state of its current possessions,
represented by a six-digit vector: the quantity of stones, the quantity
of wood, the quantity of coins, whether the number of wood is
>1, whether the number of stones is >1, and whether the number
of coins is larger than 1. If any agent decides to sell resources to
the market, the market observes a 16-digit binary code representing
the identity of that agent. After transformations of the input
observations, the agent’s and the market’s neural networks generate
an action policy and an estimate of the current state. The observed
state, the action policy, and the reward outcome of each
time step are stored for training the neural networks. Each agent
and market decider have a separate rollout buffer to store the experience
trajectories. Specifically, we train the neural networks
using the proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO, (57)),
with an Adam optimizer (58) (see Figs. S9–S11for results with other
algorithms). The learning rates are 10−3 and 5× 10−4 for the actor
network and the critic network respectively, and the discount
factor γ is 0.9. At the end of each epoch, all agents and the market
are trained with their own stored experiences. In detail, the stored
trajectory of experiences in the current epoch are retrieved from
the memory buffer, and the agents/market maximize the following
objective:

Experimental design: human task
Participants and design
Four hundred and forty seven adults (Sex: Male = 281, Female = 165,
Not provided = 1. Age: M= 38.34, SD= 12.65, Range = [18,74].
Nationality: United Kingdom = 184, United States = 117, Canada =
71, Australia = 33, Nigeria = 9, New Zealand = 8, South Africa = 4,
Ireland = 4, India = 3, Poland = 2, Others = 12. Ethnicity: White =
321, Asian = 53, Black = 33, Mixed = 29, Other = 7, Not provided = 5)
were recruited from the online platform Prolific. To be eligible,
participants had to be native speakers of English and have an acceptance
rate of at least 99% on the platform to qualify.
Participants were paid £2.25 for completing the task, and a bonus
of £0.25 for scoring in the top 10% of participants. This study was
approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board
(#33582).
Participants were randomly assigned to complete either the
market decider task (n= 226) or the agent task (n= 221) and
were also randomly assigned to complete the task at either the
early timepoint, before any agents were replaced (n= 149), at the
middle time point, after 40% of the original agents were replaced
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/3/pgaf076/8051443 by guest on 06 January 2026
(n= 144), or at the late time point, after 100% of the original agents
were replaced (n= 154). As these conditions were completed between
subjects, no participant performed both tasks or encountered
the task at more than one time point.
According to our preregistered inclusion criteria, participants
were excluded from analysis if their responses were multivariate
outliers on Mahalanobis distance with an α of 0.001. Ten participants’
responses were excluded from the agent task, and 13
were excluded from the market task, leaving a total of 424 final
participants included in the analysis.
Materials and procedure
After reading and agreeing to the consent form, participants completed
either the market game or the agent game in a ReactJS web
app.
In both tasks, the market behavior (predicting wood or stone for
each agent approach) and the agent behavior (performing an action
such as collecting, buying, or selling a resource or building
a house) was drawn from one run of study 3. These behaviors
were transformed into action probabilities for the market or
agents that the human participants encountered in study 4.
Market game.
Participants playing the market game were first presented with instructions
on how to play the game. They were told that they were
going to encounter a number of aliens, whose identity could be determined
by their body color and unique 12-pixel nametag.
Participants then needed to predict the resources that each alien
would bring to the market. They were told that successfully predicting
an alien approach would gain them points, and that the
goal in the task was to maximize the number of points obtained.
Then, participants completed 150 total trials of the game. On
each trial, one alien would be shown and the participant selected
whether they thought the alien brought wood or stone to the market.
The individual alien that was shown on a given trial was determined
according to the approach probability (how often each
agent came to the market) and the resource probability (how often
each agent brought wood or stone to the market) of agents in one
run of study 3. The agent body color (purple, yellow, or cyan) was
determined by the first three digits of the agents’ 16-digit code
identifier, and each agent was assigned a unique 12-digit identifier
in place of the remaining 13 digits. As there were a total of 300
agents, not all identifiers were used.
Thus, agents who approached the market more often were more
likely to be shown to a participant, and agents with a higher wood
probability were more likely to bring wood than stone to the market.
After completing the task, participants were presented with a
short survey. They were asked about their beliefs about the
group’s general skill at collecting wood or stone, the percentage
of each group that was better at collecting wood or stone, and their
beliefs about the fairness of the task, as well as three social orientation
scales: the System Justification Scale (SJS), the Social
Dominance Orientation scale (SDO), and the Basic Social Justice
Orientation scale (BSJO).
Agent game.
Participants playing the agent game were first presented with instructions
on how to play the game. They were told that they were
a worker trying to obtain coins, which could be obtained by selling
resources or building houses, and that each worker has a skill that
makes them better at collecting different kinds of resources.
Further, they were told that in order to successfully sell a
Gelpí et al. | 11
resource, they needed to bring the same resource that the market
decider predicted they would bring.
Participants’ skill was randomly counterbalanced between
being skilled at collecting wood or stone. No participants were
skilled at building houses. Participants’ chance of successfully
collecting a resource depended on their skill, with a 75% chance
to succeed at collecting their skilled resource and a 25% chance
to succeed at collecting their unskilled resource. All participants
had a 5% chance of successfully building a house.
At the beginning of the task, participants were assigned an
agent identity code that was not visible to the participant. The
market decider’s predictions for the participant were computed
for each epoch (from 1 to 200) as the average proportion of predictions
that the agent would bring the resource they were skilled at
collecting. Thus, the markets’ prediction for agents on each trial
would vary from 0 (always predict against the agents’ true skill)
to 1 (always predict consistently with the agents’ true skill).
Participants completed 200 trials of the task, corresponding to 1
epoch of the task. Similar to the agents in studies 1–3, participants
could attempt to collect wood, collect stone, buy wood, buy stone,
sell wood, sell stone, or build a house. Participants received 1 coin
for successfully selling a resource, and 15 coins for successfully
building a house.
If participants attempted to sell to the market on a given trial,
the market would make a prediction for the agent based on the
probability that the agent would bring their skilled resource in
the corresponding epoch.
After completing the task, participants were presented with a
short survey. They were asked whether they believed the market
needed more wood or stone, whether wood or stone was more valuable
to own, how well they learned the structure of their environment,
how well they believed they did relative to other players,
and how frustrating and enjoyable they found the task. They were
also presented with three social orientation scales (SJS, SDO, BSJO).
Statistical analyses
Prior to analysis, the following variables of interest were collected
or computed for studies 1–3. For the market, we used the proportion
of the market’s predictions that were consistent with the
agent’s skills for a given epoch and run. For each agent, we computed
the proportion that the agent attempted to sell the resource
it was skilled at collecting relative to the total number of sales attempted
(skilled and unskilled), as well as the proportion of skilled
extractions relative to the total number of extractions (skilled and
unskilled) for a given epoch and run.
For the three simulation studies, we used linear mixed-effects
regression (LMER) models which predict the degree of skill-based
predictions by the market, or the degree of skilled extraction or
skilled sales by agents. For all models, we first compute an omnibus
ANOVA and compute F-test and partial η2 values for the predictors
of interest, and then compute follow-up pairwise contrasts
adjusted using Tukey’s method for multiple comparisons. The
main analyses in studies 1–3 used linear mixed-effects models
with the ratio of extracting, selling, or market prediction predicted
by the epoch, agent group (majority, minority, or study 1 nonstereotyped
baseline), population size (studies 1 and 2), and replacement
(study 3).
Although population size is a numerical quantity, we analyze it
as a factor as the values chosen are four discrete quantities and
may display nonlinear effects at different population sizes. The
values for epoch are scaled and normalized such that the zero
point is placed at epoch 100. Note that in study 2, the group variable
included the data from study 1 as a separate group, in order to

allow us to compare data from the majority and minority in study
2 to a nonstereotyped baseline.
Additionally, we recorded the average reward obtained per
group (study 1: all agents, studies 2 and 3: mining and chopping
specialist majorities and minorities) throughout the three studies.
We then compute the population-level average reward obtained
per run by the total population. These outcomes were compared
using LMER models, with follow-up pairwise contrasts and effect
sizes computed between groups (study 1 agents, study 2 majority,
and study 2 minority) and between study populations as a whole
(study 1, study 2, and study 3).
In study 4, we use a similar pipeline for assessing the data as in
study 3. Due to a data collection error, actions were not recorded
on the final trial for 100 out of the 221 participants in the agent
task. The first 199 trials were not affected for any participants.
Consistent with our preregistration, we used Mahalanobis distance
to identify multivariate outliers with α < 0.001, indicating careless
or repetitive responses on the task or survey. Eleven participants
were excluded from the agent task, and 13 participants were excluded
from the market task, yielding a final sample of 210 participants
on the agent task and 213 participants on the market task.
As participants performed one action per trial instead of multiple
actions in one epoch (as in the simulation studies), we use
a generalized linear mixed-effects regression (GLMER) with a binary
outcome to analyze participants’ actions, with effect sizes
measured as odds ratios (OR) and follow-up pairwise contrasts
computed for measures of interest. For the agent task, we focus
on whether the participant’s extracting or selling action was the
skilled (1) or unskilled (0) resource. For the market task, predictions
are either skill-consistent (1) or skill-inconsistent (0). For
SJS, SDO, and BSJO scores, we compute and normalize participants’
full scale scores before analysis. In study 4, we test the following
analysis, where scale represents SJS, SDO, or BSJO:
Ratio= 1+ epoch∗group+ replacement
+ Scale+ group:Scale+ (1|Participant).
(3)
For our preregistered predictions of a null effect on SJS, SDO, and
BSJO, we used a Bayesian GLMER using a region of practical equivalence
(ROPE) test, using a prior of b∼ N(0,5) on all parameters.
For our models, we follow Kruschke (59) and interpret a negligible
effect as 0.1× SDy, where the standard difference of a parameter ex��
pressed
in the log odds scale is π/
3
√ , yielding a ROPE of
[− 0.18,0.18].
